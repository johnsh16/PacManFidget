# pacmen
## This exercise was created as a part of the MIT x-Pro Full Stack coding certificate course, and modified on my own to include new features. 
## The original project was just to create a PacMan factory that would add PacMen to the DOM and have them bounce off the walls. 
## In addition to this functionality, I have been experimenting. I added a gravity toggle, which applies a gravity to the PacMen present. I added a way to track the velocity of each PacMan, and each direction key speeds up the PacMen in the given direction. The 'Freeze' button sets the velocity of all the PacMen to 0. 
## I enjoyed exploring the connection of key-press events to the DOM and digging in further to interlocking functions and increasingly delightful screen animations and events.
